                <h3>How does UK Energy Business make money?</h3>
                <p>UK Energy Business has commercial deals in place with some suppliers across all our services which means we receive a small commission payment if you choose to switch or apply for a product with us. Our commercial relationships are in place to help make the switching process as convenient as possible for our customers, and in most cases we can offer exclusive deals that are not available directly from the supplier. They also mean we can provide you with a free service. Our commercial relationships have no bearing on the ranking of suppliers in your results.</p>

                <h3>Suppliers</h3>
                <p>UK Energy Business tries to include all suppliers and products on the market in our comparisons whenever possible - whether we receive commission from them or not. However there are circumstances where a supplier or a product cannot be included in our search - for example, we may not be able to show a supplier's products because we do not have a commercial agreement with them or because they do not wish to be included in our comparison.</p>
